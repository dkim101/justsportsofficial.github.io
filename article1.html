  <h1>Going Viral</h1>
<p>EPO.</p>
<p>Yes, the steroid.</p>
<p>Epidemic.</p>
<p>No prizes for guessing which one.</p>
<p>These two words have much more of a correlation than you think.</p>
<p>Ever since the astronomical rise of the Wuhan coronavirus earlier this year, there has been a plethora of coverage regarding this crisis. Pinpointing causes through animals, tracking cases on a national level, exposing government blindfolds - it seems as if the media can’t get enough. And sure, they can’t. There is simply too much material. But there is one aspect that has gone unnoticed. Amidst the finger-pointing and quarantining, one factor has been brushed off to one side - arguably the most crucial factor.</p>
<p>Wuhan is a city home to 11 million people, the picturesque epicenter of the Hubei province in central China. (FYI: That’s more than Seoul. Wuhan is big.) When the virus was eventually tracked to Wuhan - in a particular village within this region - the entire city went into a complete shutdown. Imports were cut off. Communication became near impossible. All manner of function - from water supply to mail - gone. A hustling, bustling, vibrant city in ruin. 11 million people struggling to find basic needs for mere survival. Of course, an element of isolation was needed. This just causes chaos. Cases such as this should be handled with basic humanitarian instincts in mind. Yet, this isn’t even the worst problem.</p>
<p>The amount of misinformation is astounding.</p>
<p>In fact, this isolation method may have caused more infections.</p>
<p>It is ridiculous that not even the media has been sufficiently exposed to this calamity. Circulating stories of animal products in Wuhan supermarkets, and the resultant hate on this city, continue to rise in prominence over this very evident - and alarming - crisis. The wool is being pulled over our eyes by what the media, who want us to see something much more malevolent, for their own benefit..</p>
<p>So the media lies. So what? How does this connect to sport?</p>
<p>Recently, there have been several documentaries of enhancing substances, and athletes that fall victim to its enticing nature and subsequent damage. There was the case with Kenya’s runners and the popular banned substance EPO, Lance Armstrong and the ensuing flurry of confessions - the list goes on. The consensus narrative is that drug users are bad, and are morally tainted.</p>
<p>However, much like the virus, there is much more to the story.</p>
<p>Everyone cheats to a certain extent. This is a truth that applies to many endeavors, and sports is no different. With the heightened standards of athletics, it is almost impossible in some events to compete with those who have been ‘juiced up’. As such, many athletes feel the need to do the same, just to stay within striking range of the competition. In other words, they cheat out of necessity. Gaining these competitive advantages - legal or otherwise - has become the name of the game.</p>
<p>This extends beyond substance abuse. Take Eliud Kipchoge, for example. When this running icon broke the two-hour barrier across 26.2 miles, the world in media erupted in praise of this remarkable feat. Don’t get me wrong, this was unbelievable to witness. This was the last great barrier in human athleticism - a tier above the four-minute mile or the sub-10 100m. However, no one seems to talk about the external factors. The pace car breaking any tow. The pacemakers themselves. The smooth and flat course. The shoes…</p>
<p>Shoes?</p>
<p>In preparation for this project, Nike designed a custom-built prototype of an already-controversial shoe, the Vaporfly 4%. Alleged to improve running economy by 4% - as the name suggests - the use of this shoe was met with equal parts skepticism and excitement. In addition to the sub-2 challenge, 31 of the top 36 runners in the six World Marathon Majors stops wore this shoe - and the benefits they reaped were substantial, to the point where the IAAF have considered banning these shoes and alleviating the increase in ‘technical doping’. Athletics has now become as dependent on the equipment as on the athletes. Yet, once again, as much coverage as this topic has finally warranted, much of it has been spun out of control.</p>
<p>It is said that any story is made up of our perspective, their perspective and the truth. The fact of the matter for all of these cases is that their perspective has influenced ours, and marred the truth. The fear of the virus has overcome the spread of the virus itself; we have disregarded the city in most need in the process. The disgust over technical and substance doping has overshadowed the fact that, as much as we hate to believe it, almost everyone is doing it. This is a truth that no one seems to see - or want to see. We would rather view the subjects as responsible for their own consequences, and not as victims of a more profound and difficult cause. We naturally want to victimize Wuhan for their ‘foolish actions’, and want to justify and ignore their cruel isolation when really, we are the ones that have mishandled the response. We naturally denigrate doping when we can just as easily draw parallels to some of the things we do to stay within earshot of our own competition (I see you looking at my test).</p>
<p>It is the role of media to create these enticing storylines, these dramatic headlines. It shouldn’t influence what we truly know and believe in, but it has.</p>
<p>Is it naivete? Is it laziness? Or a bit of both?</p>
<p>Either way, these recent events have opened my eyes to a lot more than hand-washing techniques and mask brands.</p>
